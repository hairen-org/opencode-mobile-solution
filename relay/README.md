# OpenCode Relay

A Node.js relay that lets OpenCode Mobile control the OpenCode sessions on every authorized machine connected to the relay. The web Dashboard uses a passkey; pairing a phone is a one-tap QR flow with no URL, username, password, or token entry.

```text
Browser ──Passkey──▶ Dashboard ──one-time QR──▶ iPhone
                                              │
                                              ▼
Mobile App ──permanent device credential──▶ Relay ──▶ authorized OpenCode targets
```

The relay stores only a SHA-256 hash of each paired device credential and translates
`Authorization: Bearer <device-token>` (from mobile clients) into
`Authorization: Basic <user:pass>` (to the local OpenCode server) and enforces each
client's target/directory scope. It runs on the same host as the backends, bound to
loopback, and is published to the tailnet by `tailscale serve` (`host/deploy-macos.sh` sets
this up), or put behind Caddy or nginx where there is no tailnet.

---

## Why

OpenCode's `serve` mode exposes a full REST API with HTTP Basic Auth. You could hand that one password to every device. But:

1. You don't want every mobile device holding your `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`
2. You want to add/revoke devices individually
3. You want the app to work for multiple users, each with their own token

This relay gives each paired phone its own credential. The QR code is single-use and expires after two minutes. The resulting device credential has no time-based expiry, survives relay restarts, and remains valid until it is revoked from the passkey-protected Dashboard. Revocation also closes that device's active event streams immediately.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy the package to the host

The relay runs on the same machine as the backends it fronts. Copy `relay/` to
the host; there is no remote deployment step and no VPS.

### 2. Install

```bash
# Create code and credential directories, then install the locked dependencies
sudo mkdir -p /opt/opencode-relay /etc/opencode-relay
sudo npm ci --omit=dev --prefix /opt/opencode-relay

# Create tokens file
sudo cp /tmp/tokens.example.json /etc/opencode-relay/tokens.json
sudo chmod 600 /etc/opencode-relay/tokens.json

# Generate a real token
NODE_TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
echo "Generated token: $NODE_TOKEN"

# Edit tokens.json with real values
sudo nano /etc/opencode-relay/tokens.json
```

### 3. Configure tokens

```json
{
  "tokens": {
    "my-iphone": {
      "token": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
      "name": "My iPhone",
      "basic_user": "opencode",
      "basic_pass": "YOUR_OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD",
      "directory": null
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `token` | Yes | The bearer token the mobile app sends. Generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` |
| `name` | No | Human-readable label (shows in relay logs) |
| `basic_user` | No | OpenCode basic auth username (default: `opencode`) |
| `basic_pass` | Yes | OpenCode basic auth password (`OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD`) |
| `directory` | No | Pin this device to a specific project directory |

Tokens are hot-reloaded every 60 seconds. Add, remove, or change tokens without restarting.

The preferred v2 configuration separates backend targets from clients and supports
`pinnedDirectory` plus `allowedDirectories`. Mobile clients send the same canonical
directory in the OpenCode `directory` query parameter and `X-OpenCode-Directory` header.
The relay validates both inputs, rejects conflicts/disallowed directories, and rewrites a
pinned directory before forwarding. The legacy `tokens` shape above remains supported and
is migrated in memory.

An owner client may authorize more than one backend with `targetIDs` while retaining
`targetID` as its default. `GET /relay/targets` returns only the authorized target IDs and
display names; it never returns target addresses or Basic credentials. Requests select a
machine with `X-OpenCode-Target`. The relay validates that selection before proxying, so a
session discovered on one machine cannot be accidentally dispatched to another.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "targets": {
    "windows": { "displayName": "Windows workstation", "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 4096, "basicUser": "opencode", "basicPass": "..." },
    "mac": { "displayName": "MacBook", "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 4098, "basicUser": "opencode", "basicPass": "..." }
  },
  "clients": {
    "owner-phone": {
      "clientID": "owner-phone",
      "displayName": "Owner phone",
      "token": "...",
      "targetID": "windows",
      "targetIDs": ["windows", "mac"],
      "pinnedDirectory": null,
      "allowedDirectories": null
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now opencode-relay
sudo systemctl status opencode-relay
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4097/health
# {"status":"ok","relay":true,"upstream":"127.0.0.1:4096","devices":1}
```

### 5. Publish it

**Tailscale (what `host/deploy-macos.sh` does):**

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 http://127.0.0.1:4097
```

Clients then reach `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443`. tailscaled terminates TLS,
issues and renews the certificate, and does not buffer event streams.

**Without a tailnet, a reverse proxy.** Caddy:

```caddy
opencode.example.com {
    tls /etc/caddy/certs/example.com.pem /etc/caddy/certs/example.com.key

    # Preserve prompt and legacy event streams without buffering.
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4097 {
        flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

**nginx:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name opencode.example.com;
    # Preserve prompt and legacy event streams without buffering.
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4097;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        gzip off;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    }
}
```

### 6. Register the owner passkey

Set the public HTTPS origin and a private bootstrap secret in `/etc/opencode-relay/relay.env`:

```dotenv
RELAY_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://opencode.example.com
PASSKEY_STATE_PATH=/etc/opencode-relay/passkeys.json
PASSKEY_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=<at-least-24-random-characters>
PAIRING_SOURCE_CLIENT_ID=owner-phone
```

Open `https://opencode.example.com/#setup=<bootstrap-secret>` once and create the owner passkey. Browser navigation and referrers do not send the fragment; the page submits it only to the same relay during registration. Registration is disabled as soon as the first passkey is stored.

### 7. Pair and manage phones

1. Open `https://opencode.example.com` and sign in with the passkey.
2. Press **Connect phone** and scan the QR code with the iPhone camera.
3. Open OpenCode when prompted. The app exchanges the single-use code and stores the returned device credential in the iOS Keychain.
4. Use the Dashboard device list to inspect pairing time and last use, or press **Revoke**. No relay restart is required.

The manual Bearer/Basic form remains an advanced recovery path in the app; it is not needed for normal pairing.

## Architecture

```text
Client (iPhone / desktop) ──Tailscale HTTPS──▶ tailscale serve :8443 ──▶ relay 127.0.0.1:4097
                                                                          │ Bearer → Basic
                                                                          ▼ X-OpenCode-Target
                                                          opencode serve 127.0.0.1:4096 (and more)
```

1. **Host** runs `opencode serve` on loopback with `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` set, one process per backend
2. **Relay** (this package) on the same host listens on `127.0.0.1:4097`, validates bearer tokens, and forwards with Basic auth to the target the client selected
3. **`tailscale serve`** publishes the relay on the tailnet and terminates TLS; without a tailnet, Caddy or nginx does that job
4. **Dashboard** authenticates the owner with WebAuthn and issues a two-minute, single-use QR code
5. **Mobile app** exchanges that code once, stores its no-expiry credential in the Keychain, and connects to every target allowed by the pairing source client

## Security

- **Token comparison**: Uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (constant-time) to prevent timing attacks
- **Bound to localhost**: The relay only listens on `127.0.0.1` — never exposed directly to the internet
- **TLS termination**: Your reverse proxy (Caddy/nginx) handles HTTPS
- **File permissions**: `tokens.json` should be `chmod 600`, owned by the relay user
- **No token in logs**: Authorization headers are stripped from all logging
- **Passkey owner access**: Dashboard mutations require user-verified WebAuthn and a same-origin session
- **One-time bootstrap**: the setup secret stops working after the first passkey is registered
- **Persistent revocable devices**: raw phone credentials are returned once and never written to disk; only their hashes are stored
- **Directory scope**: query and header directory inputs are validated against the client
  pin/allowlist before proxying
- **Health endpoint**: Unauthenticated `/health` only exposes device count, not tokens

## Managing Paired Phones

### Add a device

Sign in to the web Dashboard with the owner passkey and press **Connect phone**.

### Revoke a device

Press **Revoke** beside the device in the Dashboard. New requests fail immediately and active streams are closed.

### List active devices

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4097/health
# {"devices": 3, ...}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| `502 upstream_unreachable` | Is `opencode serve` running on the host? `lsof -nP -iTCP:4096 -sTCP:LISTEN` |
| `401 invalid_token` | Token mismatch. Check `tokens.json` syntax. Regenerate token. |
| Relay won't start | `sudo journalctl -u opencode-relay -n 30` |
| Mobile can't connect | Is the client on the tailnet? `tailscale serve status` on the host should list port 8443. Behind a third-party VPN on the client, see `clients/README.md`. |
