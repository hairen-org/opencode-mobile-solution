/**
 * What a packaged build looks like on each platform.
 *
 * The two targets disagree about almost everything that matters to a build
 * script: macOS produces a directory ending in .app whose executable hides in
 * Contents/MacOS and whose Info.plist has to parse, while Windows produces a
 * plain directory with an .exe in it, no property list at all, and an icon in a
 * different container format. Deciding that
 * here, away from the script that shells out, is what lets the pairing be
 * asserted: a target that names a plist on Windows, or forgets the .exe suffix,
 * is the bug this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Paths are relative to the packager's output directory, so the caller stays in
 * charge of where that is.
